Observing Guide

> Members of CUAS have the opportunity to use both the Northumberland
> and the Thorrowgood telescopes whenever they like, as well as all the
> other observing equipment stored in the alcove in the Northumberland
> dome. To do this, you will need an ObsCard, and to get an ObsCard, you
> need to have attended two ObsDemos for the Northumberland and passed a
> test (ObsTest). For access to the Thorrowgood, you must additionally
> do a Thorrowgood-specific Demo and Test.
>
> Firstly, this guide will go through how to get hold of the keys, and
> general housekeeping points about observing once you have an ObsCard.
> The second part of the guide will go through all you will need to know
> about the telescopes in order to pass your ObsTest.
