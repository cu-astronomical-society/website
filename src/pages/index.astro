            <h3>Talks</h3>
            <p>
                We invite a variety of people working in astronomy to give talks
                to the society. The topics are taken from a wide range of areas,
                from pure astrophysics to the history of astronomy, observing,
                and much more. Talks are generally about an hour long, including
                questions to the speaker, and are followed by casual
                conversation over refreshments. Talks cost Â£2 or are free to
                members.

            <h3>Obs events</h3>
            <p>
                ObsNights (weather permitting) are held at the Institute of
                Astronomy and combine both tips on practical astronomy with
                observing at the telescopes.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also train people to use the telescopes in their own time
                through Obs demos.

                The main social events are the Annual Dinner in Lent and the
                Garden Party in Easter. There is also a squash at the beginning
                of the academic year and quiz nights throughout the year.
                Depending on the level of interest, we organise pub meets and/or
